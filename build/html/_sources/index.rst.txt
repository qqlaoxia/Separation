    <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">Biological separation engineering is a necessary technical path for biological production, and a high part of investment and operation cost of biological industry. The cost and quality of many biological products are directly related to the existing technology level, so the study of bioengineering separation technology is very important.</p>

   <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">This course is a comprehensive engineering discipline with strong theoretical and practical foundation. In this course, the biological separation process is divided into four parts: insoluble matter removal, extraction, separation, and purification. Through the study of this course, students can better use various separation technologies to design reasonable extraction and refining process routes according to the characteristics of different products, and can explain various phenomena in theory, improve the ability to analyze and solve problems, and have a comprehensive and detailed understanding of various methods of downstream separation technology of current biological industry</p>.
