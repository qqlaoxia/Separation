    <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">Disc stack centrifuges with self-cleaning bowl for solid-liquid separation are essential in many mechanical separation processes for solid-liquid separation.</p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The rotation speed of disc stack centrifuges is much higher than most other centrifuges in industry. The centrifugal force in a disc stack bowl is apparently stronger than for e.g. in a decanter. Hence disc stack centrifuges are predestined for processes which require high separation efficiency or the separation of micro particles. Even mixtures of liquid phases with very small difference in density can be separated.</p>
